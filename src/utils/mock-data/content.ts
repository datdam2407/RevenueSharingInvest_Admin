  'In the early 14th and 15th centuries, the first capital markets were formed through a financial exchange system in Antwerp (modern day Belgium — however there were similar types of markets formed in Italian, German, French towns even in the 13th century. This was the first on a larger, more international scale), which was the center for international trade at the time. This early exchange/market saw mostly promissory notes and bonds being traded or issued, but it was a start.'

  'Everyone knows the story of how we began to use basic forms of currency, like metals (or rocks?) to replace the barter system, but most aren’t familiar with the history of what we perceive as the modern day investing(or capital) markets.While most think of stock trading or investing as simple as opening Robinhood or their brokerage account and easily searching for and investing in a stock, things didn’t start off so easy.Let’s start from the true beginning of the abstract “capital market” we know and think of today.'

  'The early 17th century saw the rise of the Dutch East India Company (which interestingly still has the highest historical market cap — $7.9T — of any company to ever exist) — the first publicly traded company, which was traded on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This led to massive financial innovation; during this time [stemming from Amsterdam] we also saw the first derivatives, dividend distributions, futures trading, and short selling occur.'

  'When the U.S. caught wind of this and was able to put similar concepts into action in the late 18th century, with the first stock exchanges being established, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange being the first in the nation, and the NYSE quickly taking on some steam shortly after (excuse the “steam” pun as this took place during the railroad boom in the U.S.). It is interesting to note however that there is a common sentiment today that the tech sector is overweight in the public markets, but when looking at the chart below an interesting observation is that the largest sector in today’s markets (tech) is smaller relative to the rest of the economy when speaking historically:'
